									<h2>Introduction</h2>
                                    					<p>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women – 1 in 8 women in the United States will be diagnosed at some point in their life. Mammographic images are used to detect abnormal masses in breast tissue. Based on the observed attributes of the mass, a physician may recommend a biopsy to determine a diagnosis. A fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a common form of the procedure, in which a physician uses a needle attached to a syringe to withdraw tissue or fluid from the mass. Mammographic images and FNA biopsies tend to have diagnosis inaccuracies, yielding false negative rate of 20% and 12%, respectively. False negative, or Type II, diagnosis results are the most damaging as they allow breast cancer to remain undetected and treatment to be delayed. Delays in treatment increase the risk of metastasis, which can reduce life expectancy. I will use the Haberman’s Survival dataset to determine which variables are most significant to the survival of a patient. I will use the Mammographic Imaging and Biopsy datasets to determine which variables are most significant to predict breast cancer with high accuracy and perfect recall, avoiding any false negative predictions. This will ensure breast cancer does not go undetected and increases survival.</p>

									<h2>Research Questions</h2>
									<p>Using different datasets, I will answer the following questions:</p>
                                    					<ul>
                                      	  					<li>What measurements taken during a mammographic image are significant to the diagnosis of breast cancer?</li>
                                        					<li>Using these significant measurements, can I use a machine learning model to predict a diagnosis with high accuracy and high recall?</li>
                                        					<li>What measurements of cell nuclei taken from a fine needle aspiration biopsy are significant to the diagnosis of breast cancer?</li>
                                        					<li>Using these significant measurements, can I use a machine learning model to predict the diagnosis with high accuracy and high recall? Less than 4% false positive and 12% false negative?</li>
                                        					<li>What characteristics contribute to a patient surviving longer than five years post-surgery?</li>
                                    					</ul>

                                    					<p>For each dataset, I performed exploratory data analysis. I examined the variables to find which are the most significant in predicting breast cancer and the survival of a patient. I used different classification models to identify which provides the best accuracy and recall in predicting a diagnosis.</p>
                                    					<p><b>How My Approach Addresses the Problem</b></p>
                                    					<p>Type II errors, or false negatives, allow breast cancer to remain undetected and treatment to be delayed. Delays in treatment increase the risk of metastasis, or the spread of cancer to other parts of the body, which can reduce life expectancy. I used the survival data to determine which variables contribute most to the survival of a patient. I used the data from mammographic images and fine needle aspiration biopsies to determine how to predict breast cancer with high accuracy and perfect recall to ensure breast cancer does not go undetected and increase the chance of survival.</p>

									<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
									<p>First, I imported each dataset and looked at the structure and data summary for each. In doing so, I verified no missing data. The summary of the mammographic mass dataset showed an observation that had a value of 55 for BI.RADS. As BI.RADS is an ordinal, categorical variable, I have removed this observations from the dataset. No other outliers were evident in the datasets. I converted categorical variables, indicating ordinal variables where appropriate. The summaries of the clean datasets can be seen in <i>Figure 1</i> and the variable distributions can be seen in <i>Figures 2 - 4</i>. The variables in the biop and hab datasets have skewed-right distributions.</p>

                                    					<p>The only variable found to be significant in predicting the survival of a patient was the number of positive axillary lymph nodes. Axillary lymph nodes are taken from the axilla, or the armpit. When cancer cells are detected in the axillary lymph nodes, it indicates metastasis. As observed in the analysis, smaller amounts of positive lymph node increased the probability of surviving for longer than five years after surgery. These finding emphasizes the importance of recall accuracy, early detection, and timely treatment. The best recall results were obtained by decreasing the decision threshold in the logistic regression models. There may similar methods available to use on the other classification models; however, time limitations did not allow for further methods to be explored. The survival analysis conducted were based on data gathered from patients who had surgery between 1958 to 1970. Using current data would likely produce different results. I used this data to find the classification models that predicted a diagnosis with high accuracy and recall. As breast cancer continues to affect so many, I feel further research into risk factors associated with its development would provide some interesting insights. These insights could decrease false negative results and increase survival.</p>

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                    					<p>By adjusting the decision threshold, I was able to obtain 100% recall using logistic regression with the mammographic and biopsy datasets – resulting in no false negative diagnosis. The prediction accuracy using the mammography dataset was only 58.2%, which would require biopsies for many women with false positive results. However, the prediction accuracy using the biopsy dataset was 94.7%.</p>
